abstract = {{Quantum embedding theories can be used for obtaining quantitative descriptions of correlated materials. However, a critical challenge is solving an effective impurity model of correlated orbitals embedded in an electron bath. Many advanced impurity solvers require the approximation of a bath continuum using a finite number of bath levels, producing a highly nonconvex, ill-conditioned inverse problem. To address this drawback, this study proposes an efficient fitting algorithm for matrix-valued hybridization functions based on a data-science approach, sparse modeling, and a compact representation of Matsubara Green's functions. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by fitting random hybridization functions with large off-diagonal elements and those of a 20-orbital impurity model for a high-Tc compound, LaAsFeO, at low temperatures (T). The results set quantitative goals for the future development of impurity solvers toward quantum embedding simulations of complex correlated materials.}},

While this feature makes the cuprates very different from other transition metal oxides, it is of great interest whether layered d9 nickelates can also have such a large J. However, one complexity is that NdNiO2 is not a Mott insulator due to carrier doping from the block layer. To compare the cuprates and d9 nickelates on an equal basis, we study RbCa2NiO3 and A2NiO2Br2 (A denotes a cation with a valence of 2.5+), which were recently designed theoretically by block-layer engineering. These nickelates are free from the self-doping effect and belong to the Mott-Hubbard regime. We show that these nickelates share a common thread with the high-Tc cuprates in that they also have a significant exchange interaction J as large as about 100 meV.}},

Here, we propose a formalism based on the kernel polynomial method (KPM), which makes the calculation dramatically efficient. We perform a benchmark calculation for bcc-Fe, fcc-Co, and fcc-Ni and find that the effect of the magnetic nonlocal terms is particularly prominent for bcc-Fe. We also present several local approximations to the magnetic nonlocal terms for which we can apply the Green's function method and reduce the numerical cost further by exploiting the intermediate representation of the Green's function. By comparing the results of the KPM and local methods, we discuss which local method works most successfully.

abstract = {{Superconductivity arises mostly at energy and temperature scales that are much smaller than the typical bare electronic energies. Since the computational effort of diagrammatic many-body techniques increases with the number of required Matsubara frequencies and thus with the inverse temperature, phase transitions that occur at low temperatures are typically hard to address numerically. In this work, we implement a fluctuation exchange (FLEX) approach to spin fluctuations and superconductivity using the "intermediate representation basis" (IR) [Shinaoka et al., PRB 96, 2017] for Matsubara Green functions. This FLEX+IR approach is numerically very efficient and enables us to reach temperatures on the order of \$10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$ in units of the electronic band width in multi-orbital systems. After benchmarking the method in the doped repulsive Hubbard model on the square lattice, we study the possibility of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in the hydrated sodium cobalt material Na\$\_x\$CoO\$\_2\textbackslashcdot y\$H\$\_2\$O reaching the scale of the experimental transition temperature \$T\_\{\textbackslashmathrm\{c\}\}=4.5\$ K and below.}}

Recently, it was shown that a model-independent compact orthogonal representation of the Green's function can be constructed by decomposing its spectral representation. We investigate the performance of this so-called intermediate representation (IR) from several points of view. First, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing the IR basis functions of arbitrary high degree. Second, for two simple models, we study the number of coefficients required to represent the Green's function within a given tolerance. We show that the number of coefficients grows only as \$O(ln\textbackslashensuremath\{\textbackslashbeta\})\$ for fermions and converges to a constant for bosons as temperature \$T=1/\textbackslashensuremath\{\textbackslashbeta\}\$ decreases. Third, we show that this remarkable feature is ascribed to the properties of the physically constructed basis functions. The fermionic basis functions on the real-frequency axis have features whose width is scaled as \$O(T)\$, which is consistent with the low-\$T\$ properties of quasiparticles in a Fermi liquid state. On the other hand, the properties of the bosonic basis functions are consistent with those of spin/orbital susceptibilities at low \$T\$. These results demonstrate the potential wide applications of the IR to calculations of correlated systems.}},

abstract = {{Model-independent compact representations of imaginary-time data are presented in terms of the intermediate representation (IR) of analytical continuation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the IR through continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations of an Anderson impurity model. We find that the IR yields a significantly compact form of various types of correlation functions. This allows the direct quantum Monte Carlo measurement of Green's functions in a compressed form, which considerably reduces the computational cost and memory usage. Furthermore, the present framework will provide general ways to boost the power of cutting-edge diagrammatic/quantum Monte Carlo treatments of many-body systems.}},

They are basic to nanoscience as representations of quantum dots and molecular conductors and play an increasingly important role in the theory of “correlated electron” materials as auxiliary problems whose solution gives the “dynamical mean-field” approximation to the self-energy and local correlation functions. These applications require a method of solution which provides access to both high and low energy scales and is effective for wide classes of physically realistic models. The continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms reviewed in this article meet this challenge. Derivations and descriptions of the algorithms are presented in enough detail to allow other workers to write their own implementations, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the methods, summarize the problems to which the new methods have been successfully applied, and outline prospects for future applications.}},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.}},
